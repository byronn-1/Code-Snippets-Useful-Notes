# What to remember when answering code questions.....


## Starting out
Always look to the tests to see what the value type needs to be.... do you need to return a string, an array 
If you have the chance ask questions 
- is the array zero based
- do you want me to return a number or print to the console(console.log)
- can I google or use my own research
    
## It's not working....
**Don't forget to return a value** 
Especially in complex methods like reduce() and map()
Is the return type the one the test expects????

## Iterate Objects vs Iterate Arrays
To iterate objects use **for in**
To iterate arrays use **for of**

## The "loosey goosey" world of JavaScript types
The reason why "proper programers" don't like Js!
